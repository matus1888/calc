________________________
This is my first project, the goal of which was to repeat as much as possible the visual design of the wine10 operating system calculator. The project is exclusively educational and does not claim anything

## Tech

Calc uses libs:

- [ReactJS] 
- [Redux]

The application is written using class components

## Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/matus1888/calc.git
cd calc
npm install
npm start 
```
